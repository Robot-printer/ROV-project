# Overview

The propellers are attached to the motors and used to propell the sub.

The design was based on an internet tutorial.

# Specifications

There are four propellers with low pitch, per other club members reccomendation.

The hole in the middle was sized to snugly fit the motor. The blades were sized to fit within the nacelle. The blades are 2mm thick to allow 3D printing. The blades were made beveled to make them more hydrodynamic (the radius was arbitrary). The central cylinder was sized to be the same as a previous model (I don't know what influenced this other model's dimensions). Many design descisions were arbitrary.
